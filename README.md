# My projects

## [Image Filtering Used in Photogrammetry](https://github.com/jgmbl/image_filtering_used_in_photogrammetry)
Photogrammetry is a science field that deals with the creation of point clouds and 3D models. The goal of this project is to make the process of image filtering more accessible, since improves the quality of the point cloud. Gaussian blur, median blur and image sharpening are available. The project is an extension of my engineering thesis project.

Technologies used:

 - Java
 - JavaFX
 - OpenCV
 - JUnit

The code is tested manually and by unit tests.

## [Home Budget Website](https://github.com/jgmbl/home-budget)

Home budget website contains informations about spendings, budgeting and savings. It helps to keep income in balance. User can add and change data in every category. Summary contains informations about monthly budget and balance of categories.

Technologies used:
 - Flask
 - SQLite
 - HTML
 - Jinja

The code is tested manually and by unit tests.

**The website is used regularly by two users and will be expanded with new functionalities soon.** 

# Planned projects

## Remote sensing basic indexes
**Work in progress**
Remote sensing is a science field concerned with extracting information from satellite images. Usually remote sensing indexes are created manually. This programm will make them automatically. In addition, the user will be able to generate a colour compositions.

Avaiable indexes:

 - NDVI
 - NDWI
 - GDVI
 - SAVI
 - OSAVI

Avaiable colour compositions:

 - RGB
 - false colour

Technologies used:

 - Python
 - OpenCV

## Yarn Shop
**Work in progress**
Yarn shop is a website dedicated to selling knitting products. It contains tabs such as login and registration, product page and account page. User can search for a specific yarn by the search engine and add it to his shopping card.

Technologies used:

 - Spring Boot
 - MySQL
 - Test-Driven Development
